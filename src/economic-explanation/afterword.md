### 后记

二〇一九年二月的某天晚上，我无意间读到关于老人痴呆的医学文献，知道这种不治之症通常起于一个人的六十五岁左右，而就是没有这种病，人在六十五岁左右其记忆力会逐渐减弱，因而某程度上会影响这个人的推理能力。

上苍对我格外仁慈可以肯定，因为我是是在二〇〇〇年，只几个月就六十五岁，才开始动笔写今天修为五卷的《经济解释》。不是我不知道人老了其智力会退化，而是我不知道通常的规律是六十五岁左右会开始减弱。

曾经提及，一九五九年的秋天，近二十四岁，我才有机会进入洛杉矶加州大学读本科。急起直追，八年后写好《俚农理论》这个博士论文，在芝加哥大学做了一年博士后，一年助理教授，一九六九年的秋天到西雅图的华盛顿大学，几个月后那些正教授们无端端地一致投票开我为正教授。

当时华大的社科院院长贝克曼与经济系主任诺斯不约而同地对我说，算文章数量与论文发表的学报高下这些当时开始盛行的衡量准则，皆与我无干，我只是要做自己喜欢做的研究。结果是我在一九六八到一九八三年发表的一系列英语文章，今天一律成为经典。没有大红大紫的，但数十年过

去，还有不少人提及。被引用的次数只是差强人意，但西方的大学的经济读物表，出现最多的是我的作品——好比俄勒冈州一所大学的经济研究院的一份读物表，推荐的五十一件作品中我占其九。

一九六九年我离开芝大的主要原因，是那里的学术气氛过于热闹，而我是个喜欢独自思考的人。相比起来，西雅图的华大是一个宁静的地方。该年的暑期我回港度假，看看母亲，也到那里的众多少市场与工厂视察。当时我已经被西方的行内朋友认为是经济学中最关键的价格理论的一个人物，也被英国的一份刊物选为欧美经济学者足球大赛中代表美国的一位后备前锋。然而，该年暑期的香港之行，在市场与工厂见到的现象，十之七八我没有解释。我想，一个物理学博士见到日常的物理现象不会那样无知，但经济学怎会是那样不管用呢？

是这个有震撼性的经历使我决定不再读他家的作品——认为是读够了——需要集中地想自己的。西雅图华大的同事，尤其是诺斯、麦基、巴泽尔这三位，一致认为我是他们知道的唯一可以全面革新经济理论的人——他们也认为经济学的整体太不成话，其解释力跟自然科学相去甚远。

我曾经提及在洛杉矶加大时是那里的经济系的黄金时期，在芝加哥大学时也是那里经济系的黄金时期。今天回顾，对我日后从事的经济学风格影响最大，可能是当年在加大的卡尔纳普与布鲁纳这两位精于科学方法的逻辑大家。跟着到了也重视科学验证的芝大，我不仅对假说验证的方法知之甚详，而且坚信“看不到则验不着”这个简单的重要哲理。这哲理可能就是今天被外人称为“华盛顿经济学派”的

中流砥柱。后来获诺奖的诺斯曾经写下，我是西雅图华盛顿学派的创始人。

大约一九七三年，一家大名的出版社的经济主编找我，给我优厚条件，要求我写一本关于经济学整体的书。他说明不需要经过外人评审，我要怎样写都可以。当时我不打算写什么巨著，但在他的要求下，我还是给了他一个书名——Economic Explanation（《经济解释》）。是的，从那时到今天，我认为除了解释行为或现象，经济学没有其他好去处。

不同类别的经济学我学过不少，回归统计也曾经是个专家。但解释现象可不是那么容易，更不是什么统计出来的数据关联那种往往是自欺欺人的玩意。我追求的是在复杂世事的变化中，用简单的理论推出可以验证的因果关系。走这样的路，从复杂的世事推出简单的因与果，需要有很多、很多的事实观察，不断地验证，才可以把几个简单的经济原则用出有深度的内容，才能把这些原则用到虚无缥缈、得心应手之境。

纯为兴趣做学问，不断地追求，是学问思想可以历久传世的基本要求。这些，任何有识之士，只要愿意付出代价，都可以做到。还需要的可不是什么创见，更不是发明什么术语，而是思想要有一个奇异的层面。我用心写下的英语文章传世逾三十年，今天可以确定。《俾农理论》一九六八年发表，逾半个世纪后的今天，还在。今天八十三岁了，脑子还可以想是上苍的照顾。然而，这次再修为五卷的《经济解释》，应该是最后的二〇一九年的版本。为恐修改坏了一——这是经济学者中常见的不幸——我每章易稿都征求一些朋友与同学的意见。他们读后说是改进了我才放心。

二〇一九年二月二十二日，我匆匆地补加这个后记，解释当年为了要累积真实世界的现象观察，我耐心地等到退了休后的二〇〇〇年，六十五岁，才大兴土木，动笔写《经济解释》。当时我可没有想到脑子会老化这个问题，也不知道老人痴呆或脑子老化，根据医学的考察，六十五岁是或然率最常见的不幸转捩点。

上苍就是这样帮忙，甚至在摄影、书法、散文、收藏等事项上也帮忙了不少，让我不枉此生。有这样的际遇，《经济解释》当可历久传世。

### 附录一：科斯手迹，二〇〇五年为《张五常英语论文选》写的引言

Foreword

The purpose of a Foreword to a book is to tell the prospective reader that he (or she) will gain by reading it. In the case of this collection of Steven Cheung’s articles, it is fun, easy and enjoyable task. Steven Cheung’s articles make clear what is wrong with so much of current writing on economics and what should be done to put it right. He does this by example, showing through his own work how economics should be done.

Steven Cheung was fortunate that he went to UCLA for his graduate work, where he studied under Armen Alchian and Jack Hirshleifer. He was then awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Political Economy at the University of Chicago. There he studied the approaches to economic questions of Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Aaron Director, Arnold Harberger, Gale Johnson and others, including me. But Steven Cheung was no imitator. He absorbed their ideas and made them part of his own. The result was that when his thesis, The Theory of Share Tenancy was published as a book in 1969, it marked the work of an original and ingenious economist.

The work that he has done since then, much of which is included in this volume, has more than fulfilled the promise of this first work. In this work, he has concentrated on understanding why the economic system behaves as it does, rather than taking as his formal aim, how the economic system ought to behave and how to bring this about. In his analysis of how the system operates, he uses a keen observation of the facts to support his argument. His writing is detailed, perceptive and illuminating. The questions he discusses...

examines many questions in this book, seeming to stem in the main through the clever [use?] of the concepts of property rights and transaction costs. He demonstrates their usefulness by discussing, among others, price controls, intellectual property rights, and, a favourite of mine, the contracting of the services of bees for pollination.

What is particularly notable is that he uses these same concepts in examining the extraordinarily interesting events which are now under way in China. Steven Cheng wrote in 1981 (it was published in 1982) a paper with the title “Will China Go 'Capitalist’?” His answer, which at the time was regarded as wildly improbable, was that it would. Subsequent events, towards which people Cheng’s predictions, more plausible. As Steven Cheng says, “Whether the future holds Deng Xiaoping’s Great Transformation must be regarded as one of the most remarkable chapters in economic history.” What was regarded as unlikely by almost everyone turns out to be not so from the truth. I regard what is going on in China as not only remarkable but of the greatest importance. The struggle for China is, in my view, the struggle for the world. Readers of this book by following these events using the concepts of property rights and transaction costs will better understand what is going on.

I gained enormously from discussions with Steven Cheng some forty years ago. This book will enable the reader to participate in a similar intellectual adventure.

### 附录二：哈伯格手迹，二〇一七年为《佣农理论》发表五十周年写的回顾

21 November 2017

Dear Steve,

Let me say at the outset how sorry I am for not being able to participate in the fiftieth anniversary conference. I would surely have been there if my doctor had not so strongly advised me against the trip.

Though my memory is often vague, I have a clear recollection of your time in Chicago, and of the bombshell

that your share tenancy analysis and research represented. Chicago was at that time, with T.W Schultz, D. Gale Johnson and George Tolley, the recognized world center of both theory and research in the field of agricultural economics. Yet even there, the traditional analysis had been accepted and taught, asserting the economic inefficiency of share tenancy. Your work disputed this conclusion, and brought straightforward Coasian arguments to bear. Once you showed that there were hundred dollar bills lying on the sidewalk, as it were,

It became clear that incentives were present for somebody to pick them up. And you then showed that there were multiple paths by which this could happen, and brought evidence to support this finding. Various of these paths had indeed been followed in traditional Chinese farming.  
I felt that the victory of your analysis was sealed when D. Gale Johnson readily sallied to support it, for he had been a leading exponent of the inefficiency argument.  
I remember too my strong efforts to persuade you to stay on as a faculty member in our department. We were greatly disappointed when you

finally decided to move to Seattle, but were very proud of the contributions you had made during your stay with us.

Warmest greetings to you and Linda, and best wishes for the success of the conference,

A. Harberger

P.S. Please convey my greetings to my many friends who will be at the conference.
